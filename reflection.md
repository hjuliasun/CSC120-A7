Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the House class, I had my overload refer to the original method and use that to move in multiple people at a time by using an Array List and iterating over that Array List using super for moveIn(). I applied the same function to the Library Class in order to add multiple books through addTitle(). In the Cafe class, you can buy a second cup of coffee using a simpler method of just having two inputs instead of one in the original sellCoffee(). 

Practice makes perfect! I was really worried that I would not be able to complete the homework since I struggled with A6. But I consistently went to TA hours and it was really helpful with syntax. Also, talking through my code helped me better understand what is going on/where.
